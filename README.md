# Real Estate Price Valuation

The project focuses on analyzing and processing data as well as training and comparing AI models for real estate valuation based on the data from advertisements.

The data was collected from the otodom website by the scraper that I wrote, <br/> available here: [stepkos/otodom-scraper-enterprise-edition](https://github.com/stepkos/otodom-scraper-enterprise-edition)

The scraper project was improved by trained valuation model into software that searches for attractive real estate offers and sends email notifications with offers. So we can say the real-estate-price-valuation is a part of the otodom-scraper-enterprice-edition project.
